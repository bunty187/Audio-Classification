# Audio-Classification
### Introduction to Audio Data
1.What is an Audio Signal?
   * Any vibrating body produces a sound wave
2. Parameters of Audio Signal
   * Amplitude: Maximum Displacement of a particle from rest position
   * Cycle: One Complete Upward and Downward movement
   * Frequency: How fast a signal is changing over time?
3. Different Types of Signals
   * Digital Signal: Discrete and Finite
   * Analog Signal: Continuous and Infinite
4. Converting Analog to Digital Signal
   * Sampling: Conversion of Analog to Digital Signal
5. Converting Analog to Digital Signal
   * Sampling Rate: Number of Samples per Second
6. Audio Representation: Time Domain
   * Time Domain: Amplitude vs Time
7. Audio Representation: Spectrogram
   * Spectrogram: Every point represents an amplitude of a frequency at particular time

## Understanding the Problem
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, nearly 24,012 people
die each day due to a delay in getting medical assistance. Many
accident victims wait for help at the site, and a delay costs them their
lives.
##### Possible Solution:
Creating an automatic emergency vehicle detection system that detects
an emergency vehicle prior to reaching the traffic signals and change
the traffic signals accordingly.
